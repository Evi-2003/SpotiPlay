# SpotPlay
A program to automatically find the right music video for the song, and play it in line with the song. 

# Language
I'm going to build this using Python

# API
For this to work we need to detect the song that is currently playing. Spotify has an API for this. 

# TO-DO 
- [ ] Implement a authorization for the user, this is needed by Spotify
- [ ] Detecting the songs name + Artist
- [ ] Using the songs name to find the right music video for it using Youtube. 
- [ ] Displaying the right video, and make it so it follows the song at the right time.
